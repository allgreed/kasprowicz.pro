## Intro

I like trains. I've been on one lately, reading [some hackernews in the morning](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39903738). "Los Alamos" they said. [Los Alamos chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_chess).
Interdansting. Specifically the 3rd game made me curious. How did they end up in a such a position? I'd like to see it unfold.

I could've play it out over the board. No chessboard in sight though.  
I could've... click it over or build a visualisation thingy or...

I'm certainly capable... - "too slow" flashed through my mind. But how about...

## Brief intermission

Some computer-ish chess terms:
- [FEN = Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) - a **complete** snapshot of a chess game at an arbitrary point
- [PGN = Portable Game Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation) - standard format for recording entire chess games

## The hack

Just use ready-made chess tools!

I'd need to somehow fit the Los Alamos board onto an ordinary board, but that's easy, just ignore 2 files and ranks.

Question: [can I make a PGN start from a certain position?](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/ugsrq1/can_i_make_a_pgn_start_from_a_certain_position/).  
Answer: [Yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation#Optional_tag_pairs) - the PGN format allows for inputting a starting FEN

Ok, now. How do I FEN? [There's one already](https://lig-membres.imag.fr/prost/MiniChessResolution/LosAlamos/index.html).

...however the FEN doesn't work with the 3rd game recording from Wikipedia, our ways are incompatible:

> ~ Alamosfish people

So I used [this](https://www.dailychess.com/chess/chess-fen-viewer.php)  to create a starting FEN by hand-moving every piece by (-1, -1): 
```
8/8/rnqknr2/pppppp2/8/8/PPPPPP2/RNQKNR2 w - - 0 1
```

Input into a [random PGN viewer](https://chesstempo.com/pgn-viewer/) and...  
**IT WORKS!**  
until the queen promotion on move 21. Because it happens on a 6th rank, which is illegal. But I've learned that the setup optional feature **is supported** with this particular viewer correctly.

But were the promotion to happen on 8th rank all would be fine and dandy, so... vector calculation goes brrrrrrrr - what I gotta do is move everything by `(8,d) - (6,d) = (2, 0)` - ergo 2 ranks. Yes, I'm hand-waving the chess vector algebra, it's beyond the point now!

FEN is straight forward as I can just swap the ranks around in text (didn't feel like doing it by hand in the online position editor again):
```
8/8/rnqknr2/pppppp2/8/8/PPPPPP2/RNQKNR2 w - - 0 1
```
becomes:
```
rnqknr2/pppppp2/8/8/PPPPPP2/RNQKNR2/8/8 w - - 0 1
```

For the actual game I needed some vim-fu:
```vim
:s/ /\r/g
" manualy seperate the check (aka "+") from the end and "=Q", as well as "#"
" add @, so that every special line (for example) "+" becomes "@+"
" I know... this sounds complex, however just trust me ;d
qq$^A^Aj|q " the ^A being Ctrl+A aka increment
40@q " it stops at every @+ line, but there's only 6 of them, so: just rinse and repeat until the end
" if there were more: I'll combine this macro with another one that skips a line
ggVG
J
:s/ @//g
" ^ that's why I've added the @ then, makes it trivial to rejoin properly
```

After tiny bit of manual snags, namely: whitespace around promotion notation o.0 and the Wikipedia game recording not being strictly PGN (excess "1-0" at the end), I add the metadata, et voila:

```toml
[Event "Los Alamos trials"]
[Site "Los Alamos, New Mexico USA"]
[Date "1956.??.??"]
[Round "3"]
[White "MANIAC I"]
[Black "Beginner"]
[Result "1-0"]
[FEN "rnqknr2/pppppp2/8/8/PPPPPP2/RNQKNR2/8/8 w - - 0 1"]
[SetUp "1"]

1.d5 {Moves are transposed by 2 ranks, original was d3, etc} b6 2.Nf5 d6 3.b5 e6 4.Ne3 a6
5.bxa6 Nxa6 6.Kd4 Nc5 7.Nxc5 bxc5+ 8.Kd3 f6 9.a5 Rb8 10.a6 Ra8 11.a7 Kd7 12.Qa5 Qb7
13.Qa4+ Ke7 14.Rb3 Rxa7 15.Rxb7 Rxa4 16.Rb3 Ra7 17.f5 Ra6 18.fxe6 c6 19.Nf5+ Kd8 20.e7+ Kd7
21.exf8=Q Nc7 22.Qxd6+ Kc8 23.Ne7#
```

## Aftermath

And it was worth it, interesting game - from computer chess history perspective at least. Gotta appreciate the proto-[bongcloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongcloud_Attack) on move 6!

Why this write-up even exists? It's not exactly groundbreaking.

Though short - it illustrates how a hacker might go about solving problems. Down a rabbit hole, evaluating trade-offs, repurposing tools. There's also the *aikido* notion of leverage. I felt like through minimal force I've cause an effect comparable to writing a custom chess frontend.

There's a third way **between** ignoring low business value, yet fascinating issue **and** throwing 8 more woman at a pregnancy project with the hope of speeding it up 8 times.

I sometimes struggle to given an example of how a hacker or a shaman might benefit someone's endeavour. This chess one - not a *great* example - needs more audacity and impact. I'm not there yet, but it's one of the best personal ones I've had lately. 

The next best approximation is an animation from the 70s: [How Does a Dachshund Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r16GL3N4PdM)
