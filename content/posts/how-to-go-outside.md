## Problem

You're inside. You need an ethernet cable to go outside. You're in a residential building with no fancy accomodation for this predicament.
**How does one go out?**

Through the window maybe...  
but then you either leave it open or crush the cable, right?  

## Solution

Wrong. Enter window lead-through RJ45:

Ok, good. But the resulting connection on the outer side will succomb to the elements, right?

Of course. Enter RJ45 hermetic coupler:

Are we going in circles here? We still need a wire to conect the socket in the coupler to the socket in the lead-thorugh and the later connection will *still* be exposed.

Correct! Enter, my latest invention:

Drowning that part in generous ammounts of hot glue makes it water-resitant as well. The resulting system is pretty modular - one does *not* have to afix the outer cable to the lead-through, which is why I've went on on this adventure in the first place.

Lastly, the creation it it's entireity:

## Results
It worked flawlessly for me for 2+ years, surviving 2 harsh Polish winters, as well as for my brother for about ~year. The only reason I've stopped using it is due to the contract cancellation with an ISP that required an outside aerial to work. But that's another story ;)
