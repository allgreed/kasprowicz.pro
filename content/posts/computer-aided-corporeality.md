## Get Mad

TODO:
- I want to do X
- official accessory for X is overpricced
- and overengineered
- I can do better

## Proof of Concept

Ok, back to first principles. What I need is an adapter between a cold shoe and a velcro pad. At some point in life I was 2 years and a lot of self-respect away from graduating as an electrical engineer. I can certainly do this!

So, I've drawn something, and asked my friend to create a 3D model.

I've had no idea what the dimesions for a shoe mount are, so I found a model on thingiverse and just asked him to copy from that.
TODO: link to the model

He exported the STL and yet another friend printed a few instances for me.

At this point I've notied that the cuboid to which the velcro is attached to (further reffered to as "table") is waaay too small. Also it was warped as fuck. But with a bit of sanding it fit comfortably on top of the camera and worked well through 4 shooting days.

## Let's get serious!

So I've learned:
- Warping is a thing
- PLA would be a better fit for the project as it's easier to work with using comodity printers and I don't need the ABS's "far superior snap tension impact resistance"
- I need to be doing the designing

[OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) was suggested to me, and oh boy is it wonderfull! After initial confusion (yup, you need to thing in terms of basic shapes and geometric translations) I find it actually very intuitive and fun to work with!

TODO:
- initial version
- dimensions of things are specified by documents
- encoded all that stuff
- [not yet] printed on work printer
- [not yet] add photo of the prototype
- [not yet] field report + photo

## TODO: Iterations

TODO:
- I've learened the scad language better and parametrized the shit out of the code
- Added a velcro pad dip
