## What can you expect here?
- original technical content
- my presentation slides
- links, lots of links, I'll treat a part of this page as a giant [structured, I hope] bookmark
- my values, tech stack, possibly my CV, job history and all the goodies you may find useful when hiring / working / cooperating with me in any meaningful way
- thoughts on life, the universe and everything, until I move them to [allgreed.pirate](https://allgreed.pirate), arr!

## Ok, but why?
I've always wanted a webpage, tried a couple times, but had no idea what to put there. And yet, I decided to give it another hit - I had a problem recently that I could duckduckgo an answer to, something terraform-related, and it was a wake-up call for me - I knew this is the right time to start.

For 3 months now, I've been working with [DoomHammer](https://medium.com/@doomhammerng) who's a successful writer - this got me thinking: what's the impact of writing on the writer? I guess we'll see ^^

Also today I've read [this article](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbanny/we-should-replace-facebook-with-personal-websites). There's something to it - I didn't want to be *just another* Medium writer, another Facebook profile, another ID in a huge database. At the same time I fancy sharing data, sometime personal data, with the world. Dear humans and bots, enjoy.
