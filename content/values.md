Backsotry on how I started to dig into values: Hyperexponential job interview, then I thought about, then the meeting with Alexander on the roof parking lot, then I thought about it more. It's been almost a year since I started thinking about it.

## Truth

- what is truth
    - **not** a lie
    - Peterson: better truth serves better on more levels of the hierarchy in a longer timeframes
    - aletheia
    - Jesus quote
        - ACTIING!
        - here: enterpreneurship!
        - building / improving / teaching!!!
    - American pragmatists: if you operate from truth the things you want to happen - happen

- requires relentless exploration
    - my religion

- why truth
    - "a single person speaking the truth can bring down a tyranical regime"
    TODO: research the actual quote - Peterson
    - "if you swim in foul play you will live among plague"

- manifestation?
    - "surrender the outcome" / authenticity
        - "it don't think this is a very sophisticated question"

## Rodzina

TODO: (use cyrlic, for kicks)
- expalain what I mean, Grim Hustle vibes, etc.
    - community / brotherhood, but not really...
- I care!

- "hell is other people" ~ Sartre
    - what if inverse is also true?

- manifestation?

## Freedom
- do I need permission?
    TODO: what is the root of permission?

    permisonlessness!
    not impeding enterpreneurship

- increasing freedom for me, for the radzina, for all (in that order)

- What is freedom really?

"Å»ycie to bankiet"? xD

- manifestation?

## A small idea
