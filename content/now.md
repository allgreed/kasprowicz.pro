## Allergy
My nemesis. We meet again. During my mandatory medical exam for military qualification a doctor said:

> "Allergy is not a disease"

To which in an alternate universe I've replied:  
fuck you.  
fuck you.  
fuck you.  
fuck you.  
fuck you.  
fuck you.  
fuck you.  

it's one of the few diseases capable of killing in minutes. I've just realised how much toll it has taken over my existence and what I've learned to endure with, what I've started to treat as normal. As "my thing".

I shall make a doctor's appointment and in the mean time do some experiments on my own. My brother had inspired me.

And when the allergy has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

# Ad absurdium
> Arrakis teaches the attitude of the knife - chopping off what's incomplete and saying: 'Now, it's complete because it's ended here.'

I find some kind of perverse joy in the opposition of addition. I remove. I delete. Slash, axe, weed out. Purge.

I will **not** read this, I will **never** watch this. It's a rehash *and* a cognitive warfare blip anyway. I maintain a curated playlist of Youtube videos I will watch next. As type this I go through the list and delete a few items. I'm agile like a lizard and sharp as a cutter.

I do this in the service of calm, some shreds of sanity. I do this, because in some sense I'm no longer curious, with the backlog looming over me. I do this, because, and I say this without hubris, what had happened so far is enough.

ChatGPT is the right doctor form factor.

## My current stack:
- Zinzino BalanceOil+ (10ml)
- **Zinzino Viva+ (2 tablets, 28 mg of saffron extract)**
- Zotter Labooko 100% (18.75g)
    - also putting coca powder in kale shakes [while maintaining total dose], found something undutched finally - [SHINE Rohes Kakaopulver](https://www.coopvitality.ch/de/p/shine-rohes-kakaopulver-bio-btl-100-g-7340667)
- ~~Holistic vitamin D (2k IU)~~ (on hold because of the sun)
- Zinzino ZinoBiotic+ (6g, will drop after I ran out of supply, all my other interventions are backed by solid paper results, this might be not the right cost/effect tradeoff for my current stage)

### Pracitces
- Acupressure mat
- Skinimal SPF50 face cream daily
- Some kind of motion. Wondering how to incorporate this into my routine / week template. Currently it's spur of the moment "let's go running!", which often is accompanied by "let's!" and lack of further followup.

## Call to inaction
Please don't

### Still do contact me if you:
- have good ideas on the point above
- are **not** poor and would like to improve your health
- are reeding this page and considering if you should.
