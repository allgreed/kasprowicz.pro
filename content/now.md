## Home alone

Periods of togetherness weaved with a strand of solitude. I had some space to reflect, some breathing room from the daily grind. It was a fruitfull week by myself.

I was aware that, in principle, I'm a fully-functioning grown-up - what the grown-ups call adult and pronoune "*ah*-dult". Food procurement and preparation process has such a wide tolerances that basically anything goes.

But some things have to be witnessed. Another great example of non-propositional knowledge.

## NSA-proof Notebook in the park, less.

I went to the park because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life. No VR, no AR, just... R.

What followed is even further input reduction:
- blocked Discord (expcet for Sunday when I have reminder to check it)
- blocked the orange industry webiste [except for Saturdays - when anything goes]
- romancing with Beeper again - as an attempt to block Messanger app habit ques. Although: they've removed the "updates" tab for me, which is nice already.

[Opal](https://www.opal.so/) with all their shitfuckery, is one of the most powerfull apps I have on my phone, even though it does the opposite of doing anything - it prevents me from doing some things sometimes.

I don't recommend them it, but I also do.

This and meditation - only ways to attempt resiting the tides of cognitive warfare.

## is here, just not equally distributed.

We live in a techo-vc bubble

I've had some contact with general population lately. Pure R. Refreshingly random. Offers a perspective.

## On goals [and aims]

## My current stack:
- Zotter Labooko 100% (18.75g)
    - also experimenting with coca powder in kale shakes, currently using 100% Cocoa from Cailler, unfortunettely it's Dutch processed - we'll need to look for another supplier 
- Zinzino BalanceOil+ (10ml)
- Zinzino ZinoBiotic+ (6g, romancing with 12g)
- ~~Holistic vitamin D (2k IU)~~ (on hold because of the sun)

### Pracitces
- Acupresure mat. Cheap, portable (Martini took it on the plane as her personal item), does wonders for my back after sitting at a desk for the whole day.
- SPF face cream daily (I have to do more research into whether I'm not harming myself with the ingredients)
- Some kind of motion. It's the best place to start as whenver I look someone is doing some kind of sport [and you can ask the name of the sport and they'll proudly tell you "spikeball"]. Currently: trying running, 50/50 walk:run. 3 min intervals. Surprisingly fun.

## Call to inaction
Please don't

### Still do contact me if you:
- are **not** poor and would like to improve your health
- offer support for my position
- are reding this page and considering if you should.
