(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, you ~~should~~ can make one, too.) 

Updated December 16th, 2023 from Gdańsk, Poland
<!--- TODO: do some build magic so that this is worked out from commit-->

I'm currently not in the process of producing the next thing. I'm in the process of producing *a* next me. This page is a part of it.

## Unemployment
Trying to land infrastructure / admin / (sigh) devops job - to get some solid experience in running production systems

Also: having tons of time on my hands leads to interesting results. I can ask a question and proceed to watch 2 hours of youtube on the subject without interrupting my day. I'm available to engage in activities during business hours on work days :D The alternative cost of doing so is significantly lower. I've been thinking. A lot.

If you have an idea that might benefit from up to a day of my attention the time is always now, but *right* now it's **right now**. Word of warning: the bar is set so low you may trip over.

## Know thyself / future
I've been thinking. A lot. And watching youtube. And Yuval Harari. And thinking while watching [Yuval Harari talk about hacking humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0uw7Xc0fLk) on youtube. I've realized that I don't know myself very well. I thought I do. And then I've interview at Hyperexponential.

> What are your values?

Erm... uh... I mean... \<eventually blurting a crude on-the spot approximation of the truth\>

This is clearly subpar. Why do I *exactly* want from a job? *Precisely* what are my standards, expectations and beliefs when it comes to dating? How would I *author* my future?

I shall record my answers in git, for anything not set in a public blockchain cannot be trusted.

### Speed
A theme emerges, one that I'm fondly looking forward to. It's a phenomenon, therefore I cannot quite pinpoint a source. I thing that speed is a virtue. What if instead of writing down ideas, then selecting some maybe for development when the time is right buttimeisnevertright... - how about I just implement them? As they come.

I thought taskwarrior icalendar feed. And then there was [taskwarrior icalendar feed](https://github.com/allgreed/tw-ical-feed/). Not months, not days - hours. Could I get from hours to minutes?

> to 10 ~~deployments~~ prototypes on a good day, to 10 MVPs in a good month, to 10 businesses a year

I've spoken with Puss about this. He was quite aghast.

## Purge
During the last few years I've accumulated a lot of cruft. Debris. Sludge. Be it physical or digital. Upon my desk emerged what I call a pile of chaos. It started as a place for things without a place and became the end to end all ends. It'll consume me and everything around me, unless... I consume it first. So far I've taken a half of the pile and sliced it into manageable pieces, while the other half lies dormant in the corner. A lot of other small matters were long overdue, some others require *deliberate* delaying, not this haphazard "later". Think 

> autumn, not spring

I've addressed my sleep, new glasses, getting rid of accessories of the past. Instead of everything being someday some things are now and some are never. And I'm at peace with it.

The pile of chaos awaits, where all the leaves are gold.
