<!--- TODO: do some build magic so that this is worked out from commit-->

I'm currently not in the process of producing the next thing. I'm in the process of producing *a* next me. This page is a part of it.

## Unemployment
Actively landing infrastructure / admin / (sigh) devops job - to get some solid experience in running production systems. Focus is about saying "no" to good ideas.

~~Also: having tons of time on my hands leads to interesting results. I can ask a question and proceed to watch 2 hours of youtube on the subject without interrupting my day. I'm available to engage in activities during business hours on work days :D The alternative cost of doing so is significantly lower. I've been thinking. A lot.~~ Focus is about saying "no" to good ideas.

~~If you have an idea that might benefit from up to a day of my attention the time is always now, but *right* now it's **right now**. Word of warning: the bar is set so low you may trip over.~~ Focus is about saying "no" to good ideas.

## Know thyself / future
I've been thinking. A lot. And watching youtube. And Yuval Harari. And thinking while watching [Yuval Harari talk about hacking humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0uw7Xc0fLk) on youtube. I've realized that I don't know myself very well. I thought I do. And then I've interview at Hyperexponential.

> What are your values?

Erm... uh... I mean... \<eventually blurting a crude on-the spot approximation of the truth\>

This is clearly subpar. Why do I *exactly* want from a job? *Precisely* what are my standards, expectations and beliefs when it comes to dating? How would I *author* my future?

I shall [record my answers in git](/about), for anything not set in a public blockchain cannot be trusted.

People whom I hold in high regard and also have solid background in health (Peter Attia, Andrew Huberman) avoid or severly limit alcohol consumption. Lately I've seen an interview with Robert Rutkowski who condemns alcohol and states that there are no safe doses. They might all have a point.

## Purge
During the last few years I've accumulated a lot of cruft. Debris. Sludge. Be it physical or digital. Upon my desk emerged what I call a pile of chaos. It started as a place for things without a place and became the end to end all ends. It'll consume me and everything around me, unless... I consume it first. So far I've taken a half of the pile and sliced it into manageable pieces, while the other half lies dormant in the corner. A lot of other small matters were long overdue, some others require *deliberate* delaying, not this haphazard "later". Think 

> ending, not starting  
> autumn, not spring

I've addressed my sleep, new glasses, getting rid of accessories of the past. Instead of everything being "someday" some things are now and some are never. And I'm at peace with it. I think this might be the very essence of mortality - the fact that most things will **never** be.

I can't quite see the progress I'm making. Eric said I'm slacking. That I could be done in 2 days if I really applied myself. He's onto something definitely, but I don't think that's the whole story. The pile... bear with me... is not static. It appears static but in fact is a powerful pattern in an dissipative system. It's lived through a lot, therefore understandably has experience in survival. As we speak another pile forms. Snakes. Garden.

The pile awaits.  
In case I forget: focus is about saying "no" to good ideas.
