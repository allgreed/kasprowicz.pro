Updated May 6th, 2024 from Gdańsk, Poland  
Reason d'update: mastermind meet incoming

## Focus

Is about saying "no" to good ideas. Right now I'm concentrated on:
- cashflow
- income (that most likely will mean a programming job which would also solve cashflow)
- self-maintanance that will allow me to achieve the above

## Open to Work
> Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.  
> After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.

I'm ready now. I'm missing something and it's not just gargantuan disposable income.

I will take on first reasonable paid work offer, with a huge margin for "reasonable". Preferably infrastructure / admin / (sigh) devops job - to get some solid experience in running production systems.

## Health
Singed up for swing dance classes, uber cool experiance!

## Purge (terminal stages)
I'm still not yet done (if Emily asks), however I don't feel burdened by the mess. It seems manageable now and there are procedures in place to declutter, one trinket at a time. It's been place on a backburner for the last month, but for a good reason.

## Still:
Have the following item for sale, asking price without shipping, items are used:
- "Ca$h'n Gun$" game in Polish, all cards sleeved, 120 PLN
- The Godfather: Corleone's Empire game in Polish, all cards sleeved, 400 PLN 
- Certina Ds Action Diver Powermatic C032.607.11.091.00, 3500 PLN
- Waterman Allure Black GT, but the **old one in matte black precision finish**, not this crap that's currently marketed as Allure, afaik no longer produced / officialy sold, 700 PLN due to the rarity factor
- Espresso making set - Delonghi Dedica machine with a custom botomless portafilter, IMS basket, tamper with a mat (wood finish matches the portafilter), distribution tool, dosing sleeve, 1200 PLN

And still:
- Working on my [about page](/about). Now doing values, mostly research at this point.
- Please do contact me if you're local and interested in a mastermind group.
- Snakes. Garden.
