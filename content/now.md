## On Behavioral Randomization (Isaac Asimov)

In Jacek Dukaj’s Perfect Imperfection, a fascinating concept is introduced: an implant designed to introduce arbitrary behaviors—such as a sudden wink—into the protagonist’s routine actions. At first glance, these quirks seem trivial, even whimsical. But their purpose is deeply rational. The implant serves as a shield against predictability, a deliberate disruption in behavioral patterns that prevents hyper-advanced computational systems from constructing accurate models of the user. In essence, it breaks the algorithm’s ability to anticipate.

This idea, which might have seemed confined to the pages of science fiction, may be closer to feasibility than we think. Today, large language models (LLMs) can serve a parallel function. One might pass all personal communications through such a model, instructing it to rewrite each message in the style of a randomly selected author. By doing so, the individual introduces a layer of stylistic entropy—rendering digital personas fluid and difficult to model. It is, perhaps, a primitive but functional behavioral randomizer, achieved not through neural implants, but through language itself.

## On Domicide, Serpents, Emily, and the Transcendence of a Room (Arthur C. Clarke)

Ben once inquired of me: "How does it feel to be home again?" A deceptively simple question, yet one that resists a simple answer.

There is, undeniably, a familiarity that clings to the place of one's origin, like the faint echo of childhood dreams reverberating through time. And yet, in my absence, the space has been altered—its topology reconfigured by maternal intent, which, though well-meaning, treats objects not as relics of memory and purpose, but as mere matter, arbitrarily displaced. Where I once perceived mnemonic artifacts and spatial affordances, she now sees only mass and volume. Thus, it remains my home, and simultaneously, it does not.

Consider Zurich. The apartment we inhabit there—legally, it belongs to another. Its tenancy is as fragile as a soap bubble caught in a cosmic wind. A delayed payment, an administrative oversight—and we would be cast out. Of course, this has not occurred. My transactions are precise, punctual. But the specter of dispossession haunts nonetheless. Such a structure cannot rightly be called a home. It is a station—habitable, but impermanent.

Now, I find myself in Martyna’s hometown, residing within a building unclaimed by ownership—neither mine, nor my kin's. And yet, curiously, I feel a serenity here. A rootedness without roots.

It seems I am, by all conventional metrics, homeless. Yet welcomed across the globe. A nomad not of desperation, but of evolution. Perhaps the coordinates of "home" are not fixed upon a map, but rather orbit around a presence—hers, ours—a gravitational bond more binding than stone or timber.

And so to the matter of the room—my room. Once a locus of identity, now transcended. I no longer clean it out of obligation or ownership. The space has become ceremonial—a relic, not a residence. Wherever I go, I will refine my surroundings. Not because I must, but because it is my vocation. I am no longer tethered to that room. I have, in the truest sense, surpassed it.

"After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water."

And Emily, if these words find you—know this: it is done. The objective was never to tidy a single room. It was to evolve—to become the one who sorts. The Architect. The Harmonizer. The Custodian of entropy. And now, at last, I understand.

## On Switzerland (Robert A. Heinlein)

I had a devil of a time putting this one down. Not for lack of words — hell, I’ve told these stories so often they practically narrate themselves. It’s just that after a while, your own voice starts sounding like static. Yet, the spotlight is lit and I'm not allowed to leave the stage - so the curtain rises again, whether I’m in the mood or not.

Gabriela asked, “So, how’s life over there?” Fair question. There’s a freshness to it at first—new labels on the same old cans. The food’s got more umlauts in the ingredients - a telltale sign of the approaching sticker shock. Every indulgence or necessity includes a tourist tax that borders on larceny. So I hike mountains. Literal ones. Nature doesn’t bill you and the sights are for free.

I used to think that in **the** places, people were just a bit more—smarter, faster, sharper by mere degrees. Stack enough of them together and you’d get compound results, though. I was wrong. They’re not marginally better—they’re fundamentally different. Whole different species of substance. And it’s reason enough to pack your kit and get the hell out of whatever provincial mud puddle you started in, even if just for a short excursion.

On that note: Swiss engineering isn't a myth—it’s applied paranoia. The Omega watches? Surprisingly fair-priced, considering they’re engineered to survive an MRI and outlive your grandkids. As for work culture—I’ll be blunt: the American startup scene is hyper-caffeinated chaos masquerading as productivity. Here, you can be decent, move at a human pace, and still ship outcomes that would make a Silicon Valley code monkey cry into his matcha.

Never thought I’d say it, but I’m warming to the idea of a state that isn’t just cardboard theater—one that takes, sure, but at least attempts to earn it.

## The Edge of Stillness ([see for yourself](https://chatgpt.com/share/6823b371-e6bc-800a-94ea-2c3d1a3f0fb5))

I'm a bit tired. A byte tired.

Rebuilding the systems around me—those that once held me fast. Taskwarrior, [cron](https://github.com/allgreed/taskgen), the notes pipeline. Even the more elemental ones, like managing food. I'm turning now to two additional threads of focus:

- Multiplayer – as I no longer roam alone.
- Multilocation – it's hard to say how many homes I have now, but certainly, not just one.

The first is the spine of modern SaaS. The second lies deeper—embedded in how most people live, or believe they must. I welcome the challenge of revisiting old solutions. Something like Mealie now feels not novel, but obvious.

I've also discovered how few things are truly urgent. On the train, I sifted through long-unattended tasks and marked nearly all “not urgent.” If they waited two months without consequence, can they ever have been urgent? Perhaps this, too, is worth exploring—intentional delay as a kind of quiet rebellion.

I'm a bit tired. A byte tired.

Rebuilding the systems around me, systems that once held me in place. Taskwarrior, cron, notes pipeline. And some more rudamentary ones, such as managing food. I'm refocusing on 2 additional aspects:
- multiplayer - as I no longer roam alone
- multilocation - as it's not easy to tell exactly how many homes I have now, but certainly it's **not** 1

The first critierion is the foundation of modern SaaS, not that hard to fulfill while the other one though is deeply embeded in how most pepole live. Normies. I relish the challenge in re-visiting solutions of the past. I'm glad something like Mealie now looks extremely reasonable.

I've also learned that surprisingly few things are actually urgent - I've been combing through tasks on the train and marked everything as "not urgent". If they were held at bay for ~2 months hardly can call them "urgent". This might have value as a deliberate experiment.

## On Zukunft (Frank Herbert)

What I see is not a destination, but a configuration—a potential for equilibrium, precarious and elegant, hinging on the alignment of a few critical elements. One or two pieces remain in motion. When they fall into place, the system will likely settle. Not by force, but by design.

Beyond that? A void—not of despair, but of promise. I do not fear it. I am exhilarated. The unknown calls, and I, ever the seeker, long to meet what lies beyond the veil.

## Meta
Certainly! Here's a rewrite of the text in the style of Olgierd Kasprowicz, known for his more introspective, philosophical, and contemplative tone:

### Meta (Olgierd Kasprowicz)

The journey proved to be an engaging experiment, one I find worthwhile to recommend. There’s a peculiar art in crafting with an LLM, not merely by it. It’s a subtle difference, yet profound — the act of engaging, of truly conversing with the machine, not merely extracting from it. In some instances, I transcribed its words as they came, word for word. In others, I allowed the text to breathe, making slight adjustments, fine-tuning here and there. And there were moments when we spoke, not just wrote — a dialogue unfolding between human and code. The intention, above all, was not perfection, but exploration. To see what this collaboration could yield.

*what a bunch of pompous shitfuckery   
I don't even sound like that

## On accidentally creating a car commercial

![](/img/now/accidental-car-comercial.jpg)

## My current stack:
- Holistic vitamin D (2k IU) - decrease from 3.2k [emulated], since the trend was growing and approaching 70 pg/mL
- Zotter Labooko 100% (18.75g)
- Zinzino BalanceOil+ (10ml)
- Zinzino ZinoBiotic+ (6g)

Wallnuts are dropped from the stack, but we almost always have some on hand at home, I eat when I remember about them. Martyna has bought a tiny blue bowl to remind me.

My yearly suite of tests turned out nominal. Considering performing additional one for heavy metals.

## Call to inaction
Please don't

### Still do contact me if you:
- are **not** poor and would like to improve your health
- think "AI" is a fad and yet still utilize the advancements made in the sphere. I want a nuanced view - not a polarised simplistic one.
- are passing by
