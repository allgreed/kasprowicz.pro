## Open to Work

I think I'm ready now. I'm missing something and it's not just gargantuan disposable income.

There are more interesting companies than ever before. Just a few days ago I had a Northvolt recruiter talk to me about Fourth Industrial Revolution and vanilla culture. They're actually using proper psychometrics. I know - Wojtek and Peterson were trying to do it a decade ago, but hey - it's finally happening!

I've been thinking a lot about how the Olgierd-capitalism interface should look like. The [Mark Manson - Cal Newport podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXjyzNs17k) resonated with me immensely. I don't want to be doing 9-5 Monday-Friday or whatever compromise my factory owning ancestors had negotiated with the olden days unios. PSA: knowledge economy is so much different from industrial factory work that applying the latter's productivity measure to the former is misguided. It looks reasonable at first glance, however just think about it for a second.

I don't care about the next quarter - I care how many preconceptions about life I can profitably challenge in the next 10 years. We should be having flying cars and mail-order immortality for fuck sake.

~~Holywoo Stars and Celebrities...~~ Radical workplace transformation - can it work? Will it work? Let's find out!

## Health
Tried to sign up for swing dance classes, but hit a snag (not enough people to start a new group), trying again in April.

Working on my sleep now with a bit of professional help, turns out it greatly improved my HRV initially. It prompts a lot of changes to my day, which are at least to say interesting. For example I should be outside for an hour after waking up, which turns out  puts a lot of pressure on one's day. That's marvelous though - strong opposing force can result in a stable balance. I hope.

I've hit my personal best in weight/body composition - like actually gained muscle without much changes to exercises or diet. Bryan was right - sleep *is* the single most influential thing on your overall health. I'm starting to identify as a professional sleeper.

Doubling down on chocolate - will probably order from Zotter directly. Hit me up if you're local and interested - we can get our best out of those volume discounts ;)

## Trickle-down reshuffles

I've rediscovered that my laptop is mobile. Right now I'm writing from my bed, previously it was on the terrace. This is fascinating. I'm exploring this avenue prompted by the new protocols but also by enhanced self-awareness. I didn't feel like sitting by my desk at the moment. Which is absolutely fine - we we're not desk-dwellers by design. We're mobile. Cyber-physical. It's crucial to not forget the physicality while embracing our digital sides.

## Post-truth

It's a recurring theme for me recently. I've been to Cyber Elf show, I've seen Eric Weinstein on a podcast, I've watched Inventing Anna. There's something going on in the zeitgeist. I was smoking on my porch today when it hit my - it's not really my porch and the cigarettes are not what they used to be. Yuval was spot on.

I'm not yet certain what are the day-to-day practical implication and how to navigate this landscape.

## Hephaestus Project (secret)

As excited as I was at the beginning - life happened. Turns out that grass is not *as* green and a bit more reasonably priced (thought it's way cheaper). I've seen it first hand. Most importantly there's real work to be done. And a lot of learning should I move forward. It'll probably be worth it in the end. And maybe we'll even turn a profit. Young white males like myself and my associates - we rarely lose. We'll see, right now I'm waiting for an opening. It almost happened, and then was gone, but that means it'll happen again. Or won't. We'll see.

## Purge (terminal stages)
I'm not yet done (if Emily asks), however I don't feel burdened by the mess. It seems manageable now and there are procedures in place to declutter, one trinket at a time.
