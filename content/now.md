Updated October 23rd, 2025 from a very small apartament or (technically) a very big hotel room in Zürich, Switzerland

## Work. Life. Balance?
Mostly doing work + upkeep lately. Trying to stay afloat. May finally move out of the starter pack apartament. This will help. A lot.   
Work's been good.  
 
Doing plenty of work on our relationship.  
Work's been good.  

## Outstanding items
- I went to a ball, finally got some milage out of my tuxedo
- [Nixcon](https://2025.nixcon.org/) yay!
- Listened to chamber music in a castle near the Austrian border
- I've been shot in Bergamo, multiple times, should've seen the other guy though
- Bought a Swisslos lottery ticket, in an alternative universe I'm multiple mios ahead ;)

## Ymca

Wh**y** measure cognitive abilities?

It's 2025 and we still don't have a way of tracking how different intervention affect our capabilities to **think better thoughs**.

I've seen a PoC. I know how to build it and where to find early adopters. I speak their lingo, I'm one of them.
In the hands of a capable marketer this could be gamified to absurd proportions. Normie-friendly quest for wisdom. You could get rich **and** change the world [for the better btw. if the direction of the change happen to matter to you].

Why am I saying "you"? Because I know myself enough to abandon the self-deception of me doing it. I'm busy with my own bullshit atm. I don't care about ARR, I'm not normie-friendly. I just want to see it happen. See the change you want to be in the... Yeah. Something just like this.

## On advanced 5G antennae (I refuse to say aerials)
![](/img/now/alien-artifact-tarasp.jpg)

## My current stack:
- Zinzino BalanceOil+ (10ml)
- Zinzino Viva+ (2 tablets, 28 mg of saffron extract)
- trying out **Zinzino Extend** (2 tablets, multi-supplement)
- Zotter Labooko 100% (18.75g)
    - also putting cocoa powder in kale shakes [while maintaining total dose], found something undutched finally - [SHINE Rohes Kakaopulver](https://www.coopvitality.ch/de/p/shine-rohes-kakaopulver-bio-btl-100-g-7340667)
- Holistic vitamin D (2k IU)
- **Swanson L-theanine** (100mg) - when feeling particularily fidgety
- phasing out Zinzino ZinoBiotic+ (9g with kale shakes 2-3/week, reason: all my other interventions are backed by solid paper results, this might be not the right cost/effect tradeoff for my current stage)

### Pracitces
- Acupressure mat
- Skinimal SPF50 face cream daily
- Some kind of motion. Wondering how to incorporate this into my routine / week template. Currently it's spur of the moment "let's go running!", which often is accompanied by "let's!" and lack of further followup.

## Call to inaction
Please don't

### Still do contact me if you:
- would like to run YMCA, or just about anything to get it off the ground!
- are **not** poor and would like to improve your health
- are reeding this page, felt the urge and considering if you should.
