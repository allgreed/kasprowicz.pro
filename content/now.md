Updated October 7th, 2024 from Gdańsk, Poland  

## On oil

Blood, again. This time to see my Omega 3:6 ratio. Awaiting results. Started taking Zinzino oil.

## On money

Started a freelancing cooperation, likely less coin that working full time at a company, but also less work. Sustainable levels though. Will see how it works out, I'm hopeful. It's all talk until a transfer hits a wire.

There's also money in oil apparently. Exploring that avenue as well, cautiously.

## On love

In the words of Sara: "I though it'll be full of ambiguity therefore I was surprised it could be so... simple"

## On trash

I have a trash buffer, which I though was useless. Anything but. Trash buffer is an idea that for some items if you're not sure they can be discarded you put them in a box labeled with a current date + time t (year, month). If you don't reach for the item until the resulting date you throw it away. Last weekend was the first time I've retrieved an item from the box and was relieved that it was there. All hail trash buffer!

## On wires

I've been watching lots of youtube pertaining to what electricians do. Cautiously thinking about exploring that avenue as well.

## On making my Jewish ancestors proud
