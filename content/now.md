(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, you ~~should~~ can make one, too.) 

Updated January 11th, 2025 from Gdańsk, Poland  

## On the latest Ticket to Ride expansion
We're moving to Zurich, sometime in February, until then working remotely. Looking for an apartament.

## On carless whisper
I'm never gonna dance again. For the next month or so. I've heared the Lindy scene in Zurich is pretty active though ;) 

Right now I've signed up for personal traninig to learn how to use kettlebells, so that I can train by myself after the move. Also: this cuts off enough excercise-related commute that even though I'll be training twice a week instead of dancing once a week it's still a net 2h gain.

I'm adapting to full-time work better than I've expected - I have enough mental points after a whole day's work and the energy levels seem to rise to the ocasion (o.0) rather than crumble under pressure. I eat more though - most of the days are 3 meals a day now, not sure it it's winter, increased load or both. **I can do less but somehow it's... more overall**! I'm rambling.

## On family events

I've had four Christmas dinners over 3 days. Three of them were actually entertaining.

I was Dideroted (in good faith) into learning about how cutting board hardness affects knife sharpness over time. It's fun though. My friend said that "a good kitchen is one you want to cook in". Santoku means three virtues.

## On using a tablet computer

I feel complete now. Laptop is a too-large and immboile tablet and phone is a too-small tablet. Turns out I needed all 3 [and an e-ink reader, but sush]. It's mostly for reading, mostly hacker news, however I feel I finally have the environment to dive into those fancy pdfs.

## On random thoughs
- Showing singles in Spotify artist's discography is annoying, and while revealing of a trend, it should defnitely have a section of it's own
- To the next person wishing someone "the best in your job search and future endeavors" - fuck you. I hope you fail and die. (I'm covered in the moneymaking deperatament, so this is not a spiteful post-haste ragepost, also: [read this](https://interviewing.io/blog/no-engineer-has-ever-sued-a-company-because-of-constructive-post-interview-feedback-so-why-dont-employers-do-it))
