## Future of Work

Is here, it's just not evenly distributed. I've seen firsthand how [great a recruitment process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDJA8ZTbVT8) can be. I felt empowered by it. I've learned from it.

I would love to pronounce that in 10 years the bad recruitment companies will be outcompeted, but I've read enough Dan Luu to know that it might not be the case. But... great process *is* possible!

I'm doing the evaluation period at Reef at the moment - having the time of my life :D

## Health

Continuing the chocolate experiment - my heart-related biomarkers look splendid, I'm not sure I can attribute this to chocolate, learned recently that out of the 2kk USD that Bryan spends most goes towards measurements, however all is looking well. I'm not super happy about fat being at >=17% - it makes sense though with my reduced physical activity.

I've been implementing [this exercise set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFhUacH63g8) (careful, in Polish!) as a part of my daily routine - feels good! It might've been less energy expenditure (as per my previous point), however it's easier to be consistent with a ready-made exercise plan that doesn't require any equipment

I'm fascinated by how much progress I've made by only taking 2 months of swing dance classes, there are no courses during the holiday season, yet maybe some workshops?

## Leverage

Now that my cashflow problems had been somehow ameliorated I'm left in a state where my life money-wise is pretty lean (actually life expenses themselves been stable since 2023, but I've cut down on booze and purchases) and there is some to spare. I'm looking into applying my now-frugal mindset to getting the best bang for my buck. Especially banging more bucks!

Additionally I'm slowly traversing the money-time curve towards some reasonable balance and soon towards the money side.

## Serenity
During the last month I've faced death. I've found love. I've vibed with multidimensional collective being of infinite intelligence. I've let go - turned buckets into rivers.

Rivers flow. Now so do I.
