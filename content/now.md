title = "What I’m doing now"

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, you ~~should~~ can make one, too.) 

Updated February 26th, 2024 from Gdańsk, Poland

I'm updating this page whenever someone asks me "what's up" and I feel like the information is no longer current. Or before a mastermind group meet (which is ~monthly).

This time it was Tymoteusz.

## Active funnel

Just like with deep learning in the 80's - I had the right ideas, just lacking on the part of execution. The pipe was clogged, it couldn't be trusted. And since it couldn't be trusted unclogging it became my 26th priority.

Søren had figured it out all along. Sometimes a leap of faith is required.

It's fully operational now. All that was required was [minimal tweaking and configuration](https://github.com/allgreed/dotfiles/commit/13d2aa3d76657cca7de538691d2c038f90a6677f). I'll make a talk about my taskwarrior / GTD / information processing setup someday.

## Funemployment

> After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.

You're clearly not paying attention if you don't consider the fourth fundamental function of money - that of being as system of control. 

I believe this has been so far a formative experience and am grateful for the privilege of not dying in the process.

I'm doing an interview take-home assignment. At this point I don't believe there is a "correct" way to admin, it's just a moving target of being not obviously wrong. It can be first-principled.

I've read Dan Luu, I've thought about the Efficient Market Hypothesis. I have nothing to prove anymore, because this is clearly not conclusive of anything. I'm almost ready now. When it happens I'll be ready.

## Nixification & doing things

[Niko](https://github.com/nrabulinski/) happened. Growth happened. Hypercharged. Catalyst has been applied. Intravenous palladium dichloride. Exercises left for the reader? [I am the reader](https://github.com/allgreed/nixos-config/commit/da650becf6f1af8f46e6b82d87de98b4dd8161b8). [We are the reader](https://github.com/allgreed/digitalocean-token-scoper/commit/f0cce5aa344c3eafdee9eac015a783711d7f5554). The knowledge, the power. [Ripe for the taking](https://github.com/allgreed/dotfiles/commit/53cd36234e0125211bc400b63dc524fefe26ea5b). Antifragile. I AM THE READER.

## Purge (terminal stages)
Context:

> During the last few years I've accumulated a lot of cruft. Debris. Sludge. Be it physical or digital. Upon my desk emerged what I call a pile of chaos. It started as a place for things without a place and became the end to end all ends.

Update:

> Eric said I'm slacking. That I could be done in 2 days if I really applied myself.

He was right. Partially. The some reasonably bound form of the purge could be done in a short, fixed amount of time. However the computer says no. It'll be done when it's done. And that's ok.

> The pile has been triaged and refined. Turns out most of it wasn't that chaotic to begin with. It's been dealt with. The pure, enriched chaos I've put in a plastic box, can't deal with it now. The box has a beginning and an end. It is complete. That's my offering. The chaos shall take the box first. The box is transparent so that I have a visual indicator on the chaos to air ratio.

It's working so far.

Remaining:
- Merchant's nightmare
- Alt wave
- The spider
- Little black book with a purple band
- Tanner
- Mathew's stuff

Therefore...

> So I don't think I'm done. Not entirely. But I'm more than than I was 2 months ago and infinitely more done than when I'd stared. Therefore if I see Emily and she asks - I'll have to tell her what I've told her for the past year - "almost".

After I've completed the list by a broad definition of complete - then it'll be done. You may have noticed some stuff missing from the list - I'm learning the attitude of the knife - you'll never hear of them again. Guess I can just avoid Emily until then.

### Merchant's nightmare

I have the following item for sale, asking price without shipping, items are used:
- "Bang!" game in Polish with Doge City expansion, all cards sleeved, 80 PLN
- "Ca$h'n Gun$" game in Polish, all cards sleeved, 120 PLN
- The Godfather: Corleone's Empire game in Polish, all cards sleeved, 400 PLN 
- Certina Ds Action Diver Powermatic C032.607.11.091.00, 3500 PLN
- Waterman Allure Black GT, but the **old one in matte black precision finish**, not this crap that's currently marketed as Allure, afaik no longer produced / officialy sold, 700 PLN due to the rarity factor

## Secrets

In the past 72 hours I've engaged in 3 secret projects. By a very broad definition of a project.

Also: Simon says I'm thinking I'm Spider Jerusalem.  
I'm thinking I'm Spider Jerusalem.  
To be continued.

## Health
Actually somewhat doing meditation, looking keenly at returning to the mindfulness exercise.

I've tried dead hangs - the muscles near the shoulder blades (probably have a fancy Latin name) hurt af. My massage therapists got sick so I'm not very interested in further experimentation at the moment. Should probably consult with a personal trainer and set up an actual well thought-out routine.

I've drawn blood to feed the Global Minotaur. I didn't have any petrodollars on hand to feed the Minotaur, but we've came to an agreeable solution. I've drawn blood. My own. Settled on a battery of ~21 tests (some are panels, so do they count as 1 or as the number of subtests) to be done yearly. This is the price for knowledge and I've literally got it at a discount.

I've taken up swing dancing, particularly I think the variety I do is called "Lindy Hop". I've danced to live music. Enrico told me it's good for the soul. I happen to concur.

## Still:
- Will take on first reasonable paid work offer, with a huge margin for "reasonable". Preferably infrastructure / admin / (sigh) devops job - to get some solid experience in running production systems.
- Please do contact me if you're local and interested [in a mastermind group].
- Working on my [about page](/about). Now doing values, though it's on a backburner *right* now.
- In the process of producing *a* next me.
- Snakes. Garden.
