(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, you ~~should~~ can make one, too.) 

Updated February 4th, 2024 from Gdańsk, Poland
<!--- TODO: do some build magic so that this is worked out from commit-->
<!--- or is updating the date part of the fun? :D -->

I'm currently not in the process of producing the next thing. I'm in the process of producing *a* next me. This page is a part of it.

## Unemployment
Had my taste of freedom, which hencerforth shall be known as my drug of choice.

I'm slowly being affected by the lack of fun money. And by affected I mean constrained. It was insanely worth it so far, however I feel like now might be a good idea for the tide to turn.

Actively landing a job. One that makes ka-ching. Preferably infrastructure / admin / (sigh) devops job - to get some solid experience in running production systems.

## Mastermind

I've managed to reboot my mastermind group with the help from a long forgotten friend. It's finally as grand as I've imagined it would initially be. And more.

We're currently at peak capacity, however please do contact me if you're local and interested. Exceeding capacity is a good problem to have.

## Purge (terminal stages)
> During the last few years I've accumulated a lot of cruft. Debris. Sludge. Be it physical or digital. Upon my desk emerged what I call a pile of chaos. It started as a place for things without a place and became the end to end all ends.

> I can't quite see the progress I'm making. Eric said I'm slacking. That I could be done in 2 days if I really applied myself. He's onto something definitely, but I don't think that's the whole story. The pile... bear with me... is not static. It appears static but in fact is a powerful pattern in an dissipative system. It's lived through a lot, therefore understandably has experience in survival.

The pile has been triaged and refined. Turns out most of it wasn't that chaotic to begin with. It's been dealt with. The pure, enriched chaos I've put in a plastic box, can't deal with it now. The box has a beginning and an end. It is complete. That's my offering. The chaos shall take the box first. The box is transparent so that I have a visual indicator on the chaos to air ratio.

> As we speak another pile forms. Snakes. Garden.

It did, outside the box. It is young and weak, yet a pile nonetheless. I will not repeat mistakes of the past.

What remains is not chaos by any definition, yet requires my attention. I'll name each piece for what you've named you have power over:
- Merchant's nightmare
- Alt wave
- The spider
- Little black book with a purple band
- Fumes
- Tanner
- ~~Gnosis deck~~
- Forensics
- and a vivisected rolodex

So I don't think I'm done. Not entirely. But I'm more than than I was 2 months ago and infinitely more done than when I'd stared. Therefore if I see Emily and she asks - I'll have to tell her what I've told her for the past year - "almost".

There's also some Mathew's stuff (in a box ofc) and 2 books I won't be needing until April at the earliest. The box is a problem, the books aren't.

I have spoken.

## Know thyself / future
Working on my [about page](/about). Personality is done and vetted by 3 people (need to apply Julia's suggestions though at the time of writing). It's time for values.

## Health
I've discovered Bryan Johnson, been implementing Huberman's routine for a while now. Firstly - it's not worse. Secondly - I think I'm doing better. Fitbit says it's pretty peachy - not perfect, but peachy. Obviously across the tracked biomarkers (VO2Max estimated by resting heart rate, HRV, sleep quality) and given their accuracy. I'm also keeping a steady fat% at ~17.

On the ethyl alcohol consumption side - I'm somewhere between Attia (max 2 drinks / night, max 2 nights / week) and Rutkowski (no point in ever having another drop). I've seen the data first hand (HRV dropping to 18 after New Years Eve) and learned humility. It is just as bad as they say.

Been watching some doctors on Przemek Górczyk talking about health, diet, sleep, etc. I'm learning a lot and an grateful for how accessible everything is: both the knowledge and the tools. I've added to my shopping list certain blood tests and consultations.

Looking keenly at meditation and getting back to the mindfulness exercise.
