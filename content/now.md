Reason d'update: feeling in the moment, also: wanted to post an update from abroad

## On entrepreneurship

I'm currently at [Cycle Lithuania](https://www.cyclefreedom.lt/) - a freedom entrepreneurial camp. I've thought I'm neither an entrepreneur nor a businessmen. Turns out I'm definitely an entrepreneur, in fact in entere the shit out of the preneur, and I'm a businessmen (and you are too!), in fact a successful businessmen. What I'm turning my attention towards now is becoming a consistently and repeatably successful businessmen.
 
I cannot recommend the camp enough, I'll send personal invitations, but if either of us misses it... you know what to do! Entrepreneurship is about making things happen!

I've made the call, Jakub agreed, the first steps commence on Thursday. Stay tuned!

## On income generation

Had plenty of discussions, thought and insights at the camp. I've saunaed for the first time in a long time - and saunaed correctly for the first time ever, used "summer" as a verb, tried out breathing strips, ridden a Segway.

> I look for opportunities to trade skills for money, but there's an entrepreneurial vibe to it.

Very funny.

I'll be alright.
