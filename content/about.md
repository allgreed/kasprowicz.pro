I loathe bios. Abouts. Makes me thing about these drones that start a presentation by saying 

> My name is Donald Disposable, I've been working at E-Corp for $wayTooMany years as a glorified paper pusher and or doormat. I like mountain biking.

There's just something profane and deficient in trying to cast a persona into a few lines of text. So I won't. You want to know me? That's a participatory kind of knowledge - interact! 

There are aspects though. Aspects are fair game.

## About personality traits

I'm referring to the [Big 5 or O.C.E.A.N.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) model, since it's the crow jewel of modern psychometry. In fact all other models that depend on self-reporting are Big 5 done poorly. In this section some words, like *extraversion*, although have a meaning in the everyday language, should rather be interpreted as precise terms from said model. Equivocation is the mind-killer.

Personality seems like a good place to start, a foundation.

The quotes are from [Understand Myself](https://www.understandmyself.com/) report of yours truly and the adjectives ("high", etc.) denote "relative to a [non-existing] perfectly average human". I also try to pick out the fragments that apply to me the most.

I'd try to highlight the lowlights as well, since traits are neither good or bad.

### High Extroversion

> People with high levels of extraversion are comparatively enthusiastic, talkative, assertive in social situations, and gregarious. [...]. They tend to speak first and most often in meetings. They can be captivating and convincing. They will often be the first to act. [...] They are positive and optimistic. They warm up quickly to other people.

although,

> People high in extraversion are more dominant in social situations, particularly if they are also *low in agreeableness*. Less agreeable extraverts tend to be self-centered. [...] They don’t generally wait for others to lead the way. They can be more impulsive than average, and can act without thinking.

Cue [The Prodigy - Roadblox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPbZABYQJV8)

In other words: I have a strong bias for action, maybe not [this strong bias for action](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/11/elon-musk-moved-twitter-servers-himself-in-the-night-new-biography-details-his-maniacal-sense-of-urgency.html)... yet? I laughed while reading about it though. I may take charge when needed (though actually prefer second-in-command). And "when needed" is often subject to my own interpretation. 
<!--TODO: add a footnote about that second-in-command -->

This means I perform best with either a lot of freedom, autonomy and resources at my disposal ([so much can depend upon a wheel barrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeO3jMZphhs&t=46s)) or a strong, competent leader who's not slacking. Preferably both.

I have 0 problem with talking to people, talking to people on the phone (I'm aware that some folks hate that), talking to a lot of people at once ([see my talks!](https://kasprowicz.pro/3party/)). Also: I *need* to talk to people. Participate. Interact.

### High Neuroticism

> High levels of neuroticism may interfere with both success and satisfaction in relationships and career. [...] They are also more likely to be unhappy, anxious and irritable when just thinking or remembering, and when they encounter a genuine problem. [...] They tend to experience somewhat higher levels of doubt and worry, become embarrassed a bit more easily, are self-conscious and may get discouraged more rapidly in the face of threat and punishment. [...] They can be stirred up and upset and, once angry or irritated, take a longer than average time to calm down. They can be argumentative and lose their composure.

Seems awful, right? Well, check this out:

> People with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to think that things have gone wrong in the past, are going wrong now, and will continue to go wrong into the future. 

Now that's pretty useful! Though this gift of sight comes at terrible price. I mean it in some sort of crude sense, which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatement can quite extinguish.

In practice I'm quite good at handling short-lived, concrete stressful situations (think fire!). I hate perpetual vague sense of something's-not-right though. My working theory is that my negative emotion baseline is elevated so a spike is not as disturbing by comparison, yet and additional constant effect is just too much.

> Individuals high in volatility [an aspect of neuroticism] tend to vary in their mood.

### Brief intermission

Let me interject for a moment. ~~What you guys are referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux...~~ You may be reasonably confused at this point. I'll go on more about it at the end. Doesn't positive emotion mean no negative emotions and vice versa? Well, no.

> Being high in scores of positive emotion is generally an element of the independent trait of extraversion. Neurotic extraverts, for example, would experience high levels of both positive and negative emotional states, a kind of "emotional roller coaster". ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism#Definition)

Is it as fun as it sounds, especially when you add low Agreeableness to the mix? [Yes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzMWpfHNYf0&t=3785s)

### Moderately high Industriousness (Conscientiousness)

I'm explicitly split the subdimensions of conscientiousness - they seem to make more sense this way, although I see how they're connected.

> Moderately industrious people [...] are generally quite dutiful and tend not to put things off or mess them up. They also tend to finish what they start, pretty much on schedule. Moderately industrious people have some genuine interest in considering how to accomplish more in less time, with fewer resources, and can focus consistently on the task at hand. They don't live to work, however, and do not always have to be doing something useful.

In a room of 100 people around 30 would be more industrious than I am. So I'm not the best grinder, but no slacker either.

> Moderately industrious people are quite likely to judge shirkers or people who are incompetent in a negative manner.

Indeed.

### Very high Orderliness (Conscientiousness)

> Very orderly people are uncommonly disturbed and disgusted by mess and chaos. They keep everything neat, tidy and organized. [...] They make and stick to schedules. They like everything exactly where it should be – and very much want to make sure that everything stays where it belongs. They are detail-oriented to a degree that can border on the obsessive. They can be very good at ensuring that complex sensitive processes are managed properly and carefully.

I think this is pretty balanced.

> They are strikingly rule-abiding, and insist that rules are scrupulously observed. They require and crave routine and predictability. [...] They want to do things by the book. 

Caveat: yes, rules and books, but in my case it's not authoritarian laws rules and mainstream culture books. It's more of "the best rules I could come by" and the platonic heaven book.

### Exceptionally low Agreeableness

> Agreeableness is a very complex trait, with marked positive and negative elements all along its distribution. Because of this, higher scores and lower scores need to be explained at the same time. People high in agreeableness are nice: compliant, nurturing, kind, naively trusting and conciliatory. However, because of their tendency to avoid conflict, they often dissemble and hide what they think. People low in agreeableness are not so nice: stubborn, dominant, harsh, skeptical, competitive and, in the extreme, even predatory. However, they tend to be straightforward, even blunt, so you know where they stand. 

I'll reiterate - this is **not** agreeableness as in "getting along", this is Agreeableness the trait. If this sounds hard-core to you it's not as extreme. But it's no picnic either. My Neuroticism and Orderliness keeps me in check more often than not - so don't expect tantrums or scenes.

As mentioned earlier - the traits are relative to the "average" and there are bounds on a person that functions in a society - too agreeable will be clinically codependent, not agreeable enough will end up killed or in jail. What I mean is that the differences aren't that staggering and you'll not see immediately low Agreeableness markers. In fact an appearance study I did (n=6) supports this claim.


My "nice" behaviours may be just coming from a different place than the hyperuranic niceness.

> They [...] will happily sacrifice peace and harmony to make a point or (if conscientious) to get things done. People may find them painfully straightforward and blunt.

In other words:

> In addition, because of their tendency to engage in conflict, at a moment’s notice, people exceptionally low in agreeableness do not sacrifice medium to long-term stability and functionality for the sake of short-term peace.

Better.

> They let you know exactly what they think, when they think it, whether you want to know it or not. [...] People exceptionally low in agreeableness are therefore less likely to suffer from resentment or to harbour invisible anger.

Maybe not instantly. But it's likely to get to that. Unless...

<!-- > They find it difficult to trust, however, even when such trust would be productive.-->

<!--I'm not sure about the "even" part. -->
<!--TODO: I'm not super sure about this - more introspection is warranted-->

> They make certain their own needs and interests are attended to, and are extraordinarily unwilling to sacrifice for the sake of other people’s comfort. 

What if our interest align though? What if my success is contingent on your success?

### Very high Openness

> People with very high levels of openness are extremely likely to be characterized by others as uncommonly smart, creative, exploratory, intelligent and visionary. They are strikingly interested in learning, and are constantly acquiring new abilities and skills. They are very curious and exploratory. They are very interested in abstract thinking, philosophy, and the meaning of belief systems and ideologies. [...] They are very imaginative, and love to daydream and reflect on things.

Oh, stop, you're making me blush. Have you noticed ["hyperuranic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperuranion) though?

> People very high in openness can see old things in strikingly new ways. They can formulate any single problem in an uncommonly diverse range of ways, and can generate an atypically large number of problem-solving solutions. [...] They are very radical thinkers. They shake things up, particularly if they are also disagreeable and assertive.

Sooner or later I'll take you for a ride. I've seen worlds where crypto cats *own* their crypto hats!

> They will continually seek change, often to make things better, but also just for the sake of change. They require an outlet for their creative ability, or they cannot thrive. 

Yeah, but remember the Industriousness - I'll get tired eventually. A little later than most, a bit sooner than few. There are also a lot of things that can be tinkered with and have I mentioned that **everything is interesting**? I'm building Theseus a new ship... or am I?

> They can be impractical [...]

And needlessly theatrical.

And redundant. And repetitive. And redundant. And repetitive!

### On systems

I've told you a few stories, but what you interact with will be a system. Alan Kay has put it beautifully in [this keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MqVfzxAp6A&t=745s). A person is a system, in fact it's sometimes useful to think about a persona as a collection of dreadfully distinct subpersonalities.

> When individuals are extraverted and conscientious, they are more productive than if they are introverted and conscientious.

The stories will influence each other. Twist and tangle in a myriad of colours and swarm of shapes.

I consider myself not only a special snowflake, but a also particularly complex one. Think spaceship vs bike. Neither is necessarily better. I can think of a synergy where Extraversion and Neuroticism (sensitivity to positive and negative emotions) grant me access to input, which can be studied meticulously [with the support of Conscientiousness and Disagreeableness] in a novel way due to Openness. This is how you find madness in methods and methods in madness. But remember, same affordances are granted to failure modes too.

Going forward with the spaceship metaphor: I believe there's a lot to balance and self-regulate, but once that achieved (and I had a bit of practice over the years) I can go where no bike has gone before.

Some keywords that resonate with me: research, high leverage, open-ended, prototype, interactive, participatory

> How many years of experience do you have at flopnaxing the ropjar?

Well, that's not a very sophisticated question. First of all, in the last 4 months ropjar was entirely transformed and no longer resembles anything flopnaxable. I've worked with ropjar 2 years ago, I reconfigured the rilkef about 3 times over the course of 6 months, each time it took 5 days. What number is right? 2? 15/365? 0.5? If you want a real number - that'd be Π, but I might have something perfect [for you] - 3!

It doesn't matter. I've had 0 years of experience with icalendar, but I can read RFCs, so ~3 hours later I've produced [this](https://github.com/allgreed/tw-ical-feed/). Don't focus on the Python thing. It could've been LISP or Haskell or...

I'm a shaman. My specialisation is the generation of insight through the use of pshychotechnologies. One of the practical application may be programming computers to solve problems. What would a writer do without a pen? Use a typewriter or a quill!
