## Traits


## Rules

- tell the truth or at least donight lie
- do a good job, no cutting corners (except for the corner-cutting machine!)

### Third: do no harm

I have a strong sense of ethic. I'd like to make the world a better place or at least don't contribute to the evil and malice. I consider 3 types of work with regard to ethics:
- Angelic goodies - curing cancer. It's really hard to find an ethical downside to that. Sure, someone might use the tech to cure a vicious dictator, but isn't he/she just another human after all?
- Potentially harmful - slot machines. On one hand a form of entertainment, on the other an object of addition. Yes, gambling addiction is a thing. I'll be asking you bunch of difficult questions and might refuse to complete some tasks - the ones connected with making people more addicted for example. I might ask you to stop a particular edeavour or ask someone else to make you stop if you refuse. All things concidered if you don't actually hurt or attempt to hurt other people we'll be good. Safe and sound.
- Definitely harmful - [Hellfire missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-114_Hellfire). I can't see how that can be good. I've read about a numerous innocent civilian causalities. I shall not be a part of this.


- GNU/Linux > Windows + guest GNU/Linux > MacOs > Windows
- if you don't respect my judgement enough to let me choose my own personal tools how can you respect it in other areas?
- my ideal work week is 4 days x 7 hours with 1 day remote possibility (that's still 4 days total)
- cVKi to g√≥wno!!!!!!!
