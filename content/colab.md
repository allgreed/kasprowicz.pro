# Collaboration

So, you'd like to work with me. Or I'd like to work with you. This page may help you asses if that's a good idea. My skills, expertise and all the other goodies will be probably worthless to you unless we can communicate and agree on certain elements of our value systems.

## Traits

<!--TODO: a note about big 5 with some links explaining the matter-->
Those are the basis for establishing an overview of someone's personality. All human behaviour cannot be explained solely on the premise of one's traits, however they can be extremely useful for gaining initial perspective. If you see a possibility of bumping heads repeatedly in a non-productive manner please do tell me right away - I might not be the best bet for a given venture, but maybe I know someone who is!
<!--TODO is bumping heads the correct expression?-->
<!-- TODO: is they ok here?-->

- high extroversion
    - pro: I will talk to people. A lot. I'm all around the place. I'll talk about our project / thing / initiative with strangers. I network. I will take action. No problem with public speaking (if I feel competent about the subject).
    - con: I might distract others with social interactions. I might dominate the conversation. If I cannot interact with people in a meaningful way across prolonged periods of time I'll get sulky and miserable. Same goes for respect / social validation. I might get overly excited about things.

- high neuroticism
    - pro: unless I'm in hooray-fun-let's-do-stuff mode (see above) I'll be very careful with regards to risks, regulations and compliance. I'll spot tailgaters, breaches and vulnerabilities. I'll suggest and implement a lot of just-in-cases. Can't stand long lasting conflict, so I'll try to resolve it right away.
    - con: I might get paranoid, both about stuff directly related to work as well as accompanying social interactions. Over interpret otherwise non-relevant phenomenons.

- extremely low agreeableness
    - pro: being nice doesn't stop me - I can tell you an unpopular truth, stand my ground in an argument or make a difficult choice.
    - con: might seam cold and heartless at times - like I don't care about your feelings or opinion. And that would be correct, sometimes I don't. I might dismiss or fail to notice them. I might also get entangled in an argument far beyond the point where it was reasonable to do so.

- extremely high openness

- high conscientiousness 
    - break into orderliness and industriousness

<!--TODO - some mixes of the above-->

## Character

Dr Peterson describes character as an ability to act outside our traits. If after reading about my traits you see something that might be an obstacle on a non-frequent basis this section may help you make up your mind.

<!--TODO give an example on how non-frequent basis that might be-->


## Rules

- tell the truth or at least don't lie
- do a good job, no cutting corners (except for the corner-cutting machine!)

### Third: do no harm

I have a strong sense of ethic. I'd like to make the world a better place or at least don't contribute to the evil and malice. I consider 3 types of work with regard to ethics:
- Angelic goodies - curing cancer. It's really hard to find an ethical downside to that. Sure, someone might use the tech to cure a vicious dictator, but isn't he/she just another human after all?
- Potentially harmful - slot machines. On one hand a form of entertainment, on the other an object of addition. Yes, gambling addiction is a thing. I'll be asking you bunch of difficult questions and might refuse to complete some tasks - the ones connected with making people more addicted for example. I might ask you to stop a particular edeavour or ask someone else to make you stop if you refuse. All things concidered if you don't actually hurt or attempt to hurt other people we'll be good. Safe and sound.
- Definitely harmful - [Hellfire missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-114_Hellfire). I can't see how that can be good. I've read about a numerous innocent civilian causalities. I shall not be a part of this.


## Misc
The above is non-negotiable. These are my traits, my character and my creed. However below are some preferences that you may find useful - if none of them are acceptable than we're probably not a good fit, if some are them are *not* acceptable we can with high probability arrive at a mutually satisfying arrangement ;)

- GNU/Linux > Windows + guest GNU/Linux > MacOs > Windows
- my ideal work week is 4 days x 7 hours with 1 day remote possibility (that's still 4 days total)
- cVKi to g√≥wno!!!!!!!
