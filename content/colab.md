# Collaboration

So, you'd like to work with me. Or I'd like to work with you. This page may help you asses if that's a good idea. My skills, expertise and all the other goodies will be probably worthless to you unless we can communicate and agree on certain elements of our value systems.

## Traits

<!--TODO: a note about big 5 with some links explaining the matter-->
Those are the basis for establishing an overview of someone's personality. All human behaviour cannot be explained solely on the premise of one's traits, however they can be extremely useful for gaining initial perspective. If you see a possibility of bumping heads repeatedly in a non-productive manner please do tell me right away - I might not be the best bet for a given venture, but maybe I know someone who is!
<!--TODO is bumping heads the correct expression?-->
<!-- TODO: is they ok here?-->

- high extroversion
    - pro: I will talk to people. A lot. I'm all around the place. I'll talk about our project / thing / initiative with strangers. I network. I will take action. No problem with public speaking (if I feel competent about the subject).
    - con: I might distract others with social interactions. I might dominate the conversation. If I cannot interact with people in a meaningful way across prolonged periods of time I'll get sulky and miserable. Same goes for respect and social validation. I might get overly excited about things.

- high neuroticism
    - pro: unless I'm in hooray-fun-let's-do-stuff mode (see above) I'll be very careful with regards to risks, regulations and compliance. I'll spot tailgaters, breaches and vulnerabilities. I'll suggest and implement a lot of just-in-cases.
    - con: I might get paranoid, both about stuff directly related to work as well as accompanying social interactions. Might not be a great judge of relevance or business impact at those times.

- extremely low agreeableness
- extremely high openness
- high conscientiousness 
    - break into orderliness and industriousness

## Character

Dr Peterson describes character as an ability to act outside our traits. If after reading about my traits you see something that might be an obstacle on a non-frequent basis this section may help you make up your mind.

<!--TODO give an example on how non-frequent basis that might be-->


## Rules

- tell the truth or at least don't lie
- do a good job, no cutting corners (except for the corner-cutting machine!)
- ???


## Misc
- cVKi to g√≥wno!!!!!!!
